## Engine Test
This is a repo that contains a test harness for working with ember-engines.

This is currently on Ember `~3.5.0` because that's what our PROD app is on.

We created this so we can create repro cases outside our PROD app.

### Working with this...

- Fork repo
- pull down and `yarn` in the root
- create a branch from that
- use that branch to create your repro issue
- the refer to that branch when you submit issues to the various upstream projects
